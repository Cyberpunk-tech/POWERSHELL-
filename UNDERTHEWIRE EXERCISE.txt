UNDERTHEWIRE EXERCISE

Century 1 -> Century 2
https://underthewire.tech/century/century1.htm

The password for Century2 is the build version of the instance of PowerShell installed on this system.

NOTE:

The format is as follows: .*.***.****
Include all periods
Be sure to look for build version and NOT PowerShell version
I log in with:

# First accept the host key if you have not before:
echo y | plink century1@century.underthewire.tech -pw century1 "exit" 2>&1>$nil

# Now log in properly
plink century1@century.underthewire.tech -pw century1 -batch
Once logged in, I run the command:

echo $PSVersionTable
This will display the BuildVersion.

We can narrow this down like so:

($PSVersionTable.BuildVersion).ToString()
With that info, can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century2 | 10.0.14393.3866 |

Century 2 -> Century 3
https://underthewire.tech/century/century2.htm

The password for Century3 is the name of the built-in cmdlet that performs the wget like function within PowerShell PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.

I log in with:

# First accept the host key if you have not before:
echo y | plink century2@century.underthewire.tech -pw '10.0.14393.3866' "exit" 2>&1>$nil

# Now log in properly
plink century2@century.underthewire.tech -pw century2 -batch
On Linux:

sshpass -p '10.0.14393.3866' ssh century2@century.underthewire.tech
I can tell that the built-in cmdlet that performs the wget like function within PowerShell is:

Invoke-WebRequest
Once logged in, I run the command:

dir
The output is:



    Directory: C:\users\century2\desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century3 | invoke-webrequest443 |

Century 3 -> Century 4
https://underthewire.tech/century/century3.htm

The password for Century4 is the number of files on the desktop.

I log in with:

plink century3@century.underthewire.tech -pw "invoke-webrequest443" -batch
On Linux:

    sshpass -p "invoke-webrequest443" ssh century3@century.underthewire.tech
I run the following to get the count of files in the Desktop:

(ls -File | Measure-Object).Count
This value tells me the

With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century4 | 123 |

Century 4 -> Century 5
https://underthewire.tech/century/century4.htm

The password for Century5 is the name of the file within a directory on the desktop that has spaces in its name.

NOTE:

The password will be lowercase no matter how it appears on the screen.
I log in with:

plink century4@century.underthewire.tech -pw "123" -batch
On Linux:

sshpass -p "123" ssh century4@century.underthewire.tech
I ran the following to get the files in the directory that have spaces in the name:

ls | Where { $_.Name -Match " " } | % { dir $_ | Select Name }
With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century5 | 61580 |

Century 5 -> Century 6
https://underthewire.tech/century/century5.htm

The password for Century6 is the short name of the domain in which this system resides in > PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.

NOTE:

If the short name of the domain is "blob" and the file on the desktop is named "1234", the > password would be "blob1234".
The password will be lowercase no matter how it appears on the screen.
I log in with:

plink century5@century.underthewire.tech -pw "61580" -batch
On Linux:

sshpass -p "61580" ssh century5@century.underthewire.tech
I ran the following to get the short domain name. I'm using some WMI here!

(gwmi Win32_NTDomain).DomainName
This returned underthewire. And to get the filename on the Desktop:

ls
# 3347
With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century6 | underthewire3347 |

Century 6 -> Century 7
https://underthewire.tech/century/century6.htm

The password for Century7 is the number of folders on the desktop.

I log in with:

plink century6@century.underthewire.tech -pw "underthewire3347" -batch
On Linux:

sshpass -p "underthewire3347" ssh century6@century.underthewire.tech
With this command I could get the number of folders on the desktop.

(ls -Directory | measure).Count
197
With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century7 | 197 |

Century 7 -> Century 8

The password for Century8 is in a readme file somewhere within the contacts, desktop, documents, downloads, favorites, music, or videos folder in the user's profile.

I log in with:

plink century7@century.underthewire.tech -pw "197" -batch
On Linux:

sshpass -p "197" ssh century7@century.underthewire.tech
I ran this to find the files in the directories.

cd ..
ls -Recurse 
I found within Downloads, the Readme.txt file.

C:\users\century7\Downloads\Readme.txt
With that info, we can determine the credentials for the next level:

| century8 | 7points |
